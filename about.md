# Some details about these pages
Hi, my name is Markus and I'm a geophysicist based in Berlin, Germany who has gradually moved into data science 
i.e. going from working for the hydrocarbon industry to the finance/banking sector.  
This compilation began as my way to keep somehow track of my IT knowledge which I picked up over time but specifically concentrated
in a training course on cloud computing in summer 2021. I felt that I needed to move from files and *.ppt/screenshots to
someting more durable.  
Hence I started hosting a static webpage on highly available AWS-S3 connected to a CodePipeline which I can push occasionally 
with an upload to my GitHub repository.

In the meantime I have added my "own" domain name, TSL encryption, and an API gateway to the mix.
