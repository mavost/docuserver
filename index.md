# Welcome to the MavoSt Docuserver Wiki pages

This is a little web space where I maintain my collected knowledge on Linux and cloud technologies.  
As information is coming in from different directions I try to add sources as much as possible.
Feel free to browse...  
Live instance currently accessible as:

- hosted on [AWS S3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/WebsiteHosting.html),

- using a free [Freenom](https://www.freenom.com/en/index.html?lang=en) domain,

- and changes to the code base in [GitHub](https://github.com/mavost/docuserver) are automatically deployed using [AWS Codepipeline](https://aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/?nc=bc&pg=pr)

see [cloud-webhosting](https://rajesh-r6r.medium.com/hosting-a-free-website-on-aws-s3-with-freenom-domains-for-dummies-a363aac39b1e)
and [code pipeline](https://james-turner.medium.com/connecting-github-to-aws-codepipeline-ce19a4a2f213) examples to replicate this setup.
